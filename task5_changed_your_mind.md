# Default is "World"
name=${1:-"World"}
echo "Hello, $name"
```

# This is an unwanted but staged comment
```

git commit -m "Oops: committed unwanted comment"
```

```bash
git reset --hard v1
```

‚úÖ HEAD now points to `v1`.

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Viewing Deleted Commits

Showed logs (deleted commits still appear as dangling):
```bash
git log --oneline --all
```

To verify:
```bash
git log --oneline
```

---

## 6Ô∏è‚É£ Cleaning Unreferenced Commits

Used garbage collection to clean dangling commits:
```bash
git gc --prune=now
```

‚úÖ Deleted unreferenced commits from reflog and history.

## 7Ô∏è‚É£ Author Information

Added author line:
```bash
# Author: Jim Weirich
```

Then committed:
```bash
git commit -m "Add author name to hello.sh"
```

Amended the commit to include email:
```bash
# Author: Jim Weirich <jim@example.com>
```

Without creating a new commit:
```bash
git add hello.sh
git commit --amend --no-edit
```

‚úÖ Final version includes name and email in the same commit.
